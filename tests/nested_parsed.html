This is an example of nested templates:
{{>nested_block}} The > syntax specifies that this block will contain a nested template. By default, spacing is not propogated to the nested template.
    {{name}} - by default, HTML is escaped:
<h3>Hello, the name is Tripp.</h3>

{{&name}} - permits raw HTML:
<h3>Hello, the name is Tripp.</h3>
    
{{>>nested_block}} The >> sytnax progates spacing to the nested template block.
    {{name}} - by default, HTML is escaped:
    <h3>Hello, the name is Tripp.</h3>
    
    {{&name}} - permits raw HTML:
    <h3>Hello, the name is Tripp.</h3>
